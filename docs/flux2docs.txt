About

   Edit an image using the Flux 2 model.

1. Calling the API#

Install the client#

   The client provides a convenient way to interact with the model API.
   (BUTTON) npm (BUTTON) yarn (BUTTON) pnpm (BUTTON) bun
   (copyCode)
npm install --save @fal-ai/client

Migrate to @fal-ai/client

   The @fal-ai/serverless-client package has been deprecated in favor of
   @fal-ai/client. Please check the migration guide for more information.

Setup your API Key#

   Set FAL_KEY as an environment variable in your runtime.
   (copyCode)
export FAL_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

Submit a request#

   The client API handles the API submit protocol. It will handle the
   request status updates and return the result when the request is
   completed.
   (copyCode)
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.subscribe("fal-ai/alpha-image-232/edit-image", {
  input: {
    prompt: ""
  },
  logs: true,
  onQueueUpdate: (update) => {
    if (update.status === "IN_PROGRESS") {
      update.logs.map((log) => log.message).forEach(console.log);
    }
  },
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);

2. Authentication#

   The API uses an API Key for authentication. It is recommended you set
   the FAL_KEY environment variable in your runtime when possible.

API Key#

   In case your app is running in an environment where you cannot set
   environment variables, you can set the API Key manually as a client
   configuration.
   (copyCode)
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

fal.config({
  credentials: "YOUR_FAL_KEY"
});

Protect your API Key

   When running code on the client-side (e.g. in a browser, mobile app or
   GUI applications), make sure to not expose your FAL_KEY. Instead, use a
   server-side proxy to make requests to the API. For more information,
   check out our server-side integration guide.

3. Queue#

Long-running requests

   For long-running requests, such as training jobs or models with slower
   inference times, it is recommended to check the Queue status and rely
   on Webhooks instead of blocking while waiting for the result.

Submit a request#

   The client API provides a convenient way to submit requests to the
   model.
   (copyCode)
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const { request_id } = await fal.queue.submit("fal-ai/alpha-image-232/edit-image
", {
  input: {
    prompt: ""
  },
  webhookUrl: "https://optional.webhook.url/for/results",
});

Fetch request status#

   You can fetch the status of a request to check if it is completed or
   still in progress.
   (copyCode)
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const status = await fal.queue.status("fal-ai/alpha-image-232/edit-image", {
  requestId: "764cabcf-b745-4b3e-ae38-1200304cf45b",
  logs: true,
});

Get the result#

   Once the request is completed, you can fetch the result. See the Output
   Schema for the expected result format.
   (copyCode)
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const result = await fal.queue.result("fal-ai/alpha-image-232/edit-image", {
  requestId: "764cabcf-b745-4b3e-ae38-1200304cf45b"
});
console.log(result.data);
console.log(result.requestId);

4. Files#

   Some attributes in the API accept file URLs as input. Whenever that's
   the case you can pass your own URL or a Base64 data URI.

Data URI (base64)#

   You can pass a Base64 data URI as a file input. The API will handle the
   file decoding for you. Keep in mind that for large files, this
   alternative although convenient can impact the request performance.

Hosted files (URL)#

   You can also pass your own URLs as long as they are publicly
   accessible. Be aware that some hosts might block cross-site requests,
   rate-limit, or consider the request as a bot.

Uploading files#

   We provide a convenient file storage that allows you to upload files
   and use them in your requests. You can upload files using the client
   API and use the returned URL in your requests.
   (copyCode)
import { fal } from "@fal-ai/client";

const file = new File(["Hello, World!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const url = await fal.storage.upload(file);

Auto uploads

   The client will auto-upload the file for you if you pass a binary
   object (e.g. File, Data).

   Read more about file handling in our file upload guide.

5. Schema#
